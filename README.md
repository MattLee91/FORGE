## Getting Started with the Project

Welcome to the Forge repository! This section will guide you through the steps needed to get started with the project, including installing Unity and opening the project on your system.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have a stable internet connection for downloading software and project files.

### Step 1: Install Unity

Unity is the main engine used for this project. Follow these steps to download and install it:

1. **Download Unity Hub**:
   - Visit the [Unity Download Page](https://unity.com/download).
   - Click on the “Download Unity Hub” button.

2. **Install Unity Hub**:
   - Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Unity Hub on your computer.

3. **Install the Unity Editor**:
   - Open Unity Hub.
   - Go to the ‘Installs’ tab and click on the ‘Add’ button.
   - Choose the Unity version recommended for this project (you can find this information in the project documentation or ask the project maintainers).
   - Make sure to include the necessary modules for your development platform (e.g., iOS Build Support, Android Build Support) during the installation.

### Step 2: Open the Project

After installing Unity, follow these steps to open the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the project repository to your local machine using the command:
     ```
     git clone [Repository URL]
     ```
     Replace `[Repository URL]` with the actual URL of the repository.

2. **Open the Project in Unity**:
   - Open Unity Hub.
   - Go to the ‘Projects’ tab and click on the ‘Add’ button.
   - Browse to the directory where you cloned the repository and select the project folder.
   - Unity will now open the project. This might take a few minutes if it's the first time you are opening the project as Unity needs to import all assets and dependencies.

### Next Steps

Now that you have the project open in Unity, you can start exploring the existing scenes and assets.
